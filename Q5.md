### **7 Steps in Machine Learning Development**

| **Step No.** | **Step Name** | **Explanation** |
|:--:|-----------------|------------------|
| **1** | **Problem Definition** | Clearly define what you want to predict or classify. Example: predicting sales, spam detection, or disease diagnosis. |
| **2** | **Data Collection** | Gather relevant data from various sources such as files, sensors, databases, or APIs. The quality and quantity of data affect model accuracy. |
| **3** | **Data Preprocessing** | Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing or scaling data. This ensures the data is ready for modeling. |
| **4** | **Feature Selection and Engineering** | Select the most important variables (features) and create new ones if needed. Good features improve model performance. |
| **5** | **Model Selection and Training** | Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, Neural Network) and train it on the dataset. |
| **6** | **Model Evaluation** | Test the model on unseen data using evaluation metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, or RMSE. Helps check if the model performs well. |
| **7** | **Deployment and Monitoring** | Deploy the model into real-world use. Monitor its performance regularly and retrain it when new data becomes available. |
