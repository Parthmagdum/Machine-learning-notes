## Applications of Machine Learning (8 Marks)

Machine Learning (ML) is widely used in various real-world applications to make systems intelligent, adaptive, and data-driven.
Here are some major applications explained in detail:


---

1. Image Recognition

ML helps computers identify and classify objects in images.

Used in facial recognition systems, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.

Example: Facebook auto-tags people in photos using image recognition models.



---

2. Speech Recognition

Converts spoken language into text or commands using ML and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Used in voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.

Example: Voice typing or calling someone through a voice command.



---

3. Product Recommendation Systems

Suggests products or content to users based on past behavior, preferences, or interactions.

Used by Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify to improve user experience.

Example: “You may also like” or “Recommended for you” sections.



---

4. Email Filtering and Spam Detection

ML algorithms classify emails into Primary, Social, Promotions, or Spam.

Helps protect users from unwanted or malicious emails.

Example: Gmail uses ML to filter spam emails automatically.



---

5. Medical Diagnosis

ML models assist doctors by detecting diseases from medical images or patient data.

Used in detecting cancer, heart diseases, and analyzing X-rays or MRI scans.

Example: AI tools that detect tumors in medical scans.



---

6. Self-Driving Cars

ML helps cars recognize road signs, pedestrians, and traffic using sensors and cameras.

The system learns from data to make safe driving decisions.

Example: Tesla’s Autopilot uses ML to navigate roads.



---

7. Fraud Detection

ML identifies unusual transaction patterns that could indicate fraud.

Used in banks and online payment systems to detect and prevent fake activities.

Example: Credit card companies use ML to detect suspicious transactions.



---

8. Virtual Assistants and Chatbots

ML enables chatbots to understand user queries and respond intelligently.

Used in customer support, websites, and mobile apps.

Example: ChatGPT, Google Assistant, and website support bots.
