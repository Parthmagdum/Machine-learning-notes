## Project Scheduling and Staffing

### **Project Scheduling**
Project scheduling is the process of planning **when** each activity in a software project will start and finish.  
It ensures the project is completed within the given **time, resources, and budget**.

Key points:
- Break the project into smaller tasks.
- Estimate the time required for each task.
- Identify dependencies between tasks.
- Arrange tasks in a timeline (Gantt chart, PERT chart).
- Allocate resources and track progress.

A good schedule helps avoid delays, bottlenecks, and overloading team members.

### **Project Staffing**
Project staffing is the process of deciding **how many people** are needed, **which skills** are required, and **who will work on which tasks** in the project.

Key points:
- Identify required roles (developer, tester, designer, manager, etc.).
- Assign tasks based on skills and experience.
- Balance team size (too big = communication problems; too small = delays).
- Provide training if skills are missing.
- Adjust staffing as the project progresses.

Effective staffing ensures the right people are doing the right tasks, improving productivity and software quality.
