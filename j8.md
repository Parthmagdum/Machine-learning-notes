### Q. Explain looping statements in Java with example. (8 Marks)

Looping statements in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. They help reduce code repetition and improve efficiency.

Java provides three main looping statements:

---

#### 1. **for Loop**
Used when the number of iterations is known.

**Syntax:**
```java
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to execute
}

Example:

for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5


---

2. while Loop

Used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

Syntax:

while(condition) {
    // code to execute
}

Example:

int i = 1;
while(i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5


---

3. do-while Loop

Executes the block at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax:

do {
    // code to execute
} while(condition);

Example:

int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 5);
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5

Looping statements make programs more efficient by avoiding repetitive code and executing instructions multiple times based on conditions.
