## Advantages and Disadvantages of Machine Learning (4 Marks)

Advantages:

1. Automation of Tasks:

ML automates repetitive and complex tasks without human help.



2. Improved Decision Making:

It helps make accurate decisions using data patterns and predictions.



3. Continuous Improvement:

ML models keep learning and improving as more data becomes available.



4. Wide Range of Applications:

Used in healthcare, finance, marketing, gaming, and many other fields.

Disadvantages:

1. Data Dependency:

ML needs a large amount of quality data to perform well.



2. High Computation Cost:

Training ML models requires powerful hardware and time.



3. Lack of Transparency:

Some ML models act like a “black box” — hard to understand how they make decisions.



4. Risk of Bias:

If the training data is biased, the predictions will also be unfair or inaccurate.

✅ In short:
Machine Learning gives automation and accuracy, but it depends heavily on good data and can be costly or biased if not handled carefully.
