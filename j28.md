### Q. Write short note on Java API package. (4 Marks)

The **Java API (Application Programming Interface)** is a collection of **predefined classes, interfaces, and packages** provided by Java to help developers build applications easily. It offers reusable code for tasks like input/output, data structures, networking, GUI programming, and utilities.

The Java API is stored in **packages** such as `java.lang`, `java.util`, `java.io`, etc. Developers can import these packages to use built-in classes and methods instead of writing code from scratch.

**Example:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner; // using API package

class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); // Scanner class from java.util
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + n);
    }
}

The Java API improves reusability, productivity, and code efficiency by providing ready-to-use components for common programming tasks.
