### Q. Explain life cycle of Thread. (8 Marks)

A thread in Java passes through different states from creation to termination.  
This process is called the **thread life cycle**.

The main thread states are:

---

### ✅ 1. New
- Thread object is created but **not yet started**.
```java
Thread t = new Thread();


---

✅ 2. Runnable (Ready-to-Run)

start() method is called.

Thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU scheduling.


t.start();


---

✅ 3. Running

Thread is executing its run() method.



---

✅ 4. Blocked / Waiting / Timed Waiting

Thread is temporarily paused and not eligible to run. Examples:

sleep(time)

wait()

I/O request

Waiting for another thread to complete task


Thread.sleep(1000); // Timed waiting


---

✅ 5. Terminated (Dead)

Thread finishes execution or is manually stopped.

Cannot be restarted.



---

✅ Thread Life Cycle Diagram (Text Form)

New → Runnable → Running → Waiting/Blocked → Runnable → Terminated


---

✅ Example Program

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread(); // New
        t.start();                   // Runnable → Running
    }
}


---

The thread life cycle ensures that threads execute efficiently by moving between states such as new, runnable, running, waiting, and terminated.
