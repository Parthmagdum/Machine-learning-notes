# ✅ Java OOP Quick Points – 1-Page Revision Sheet

---

## **OOP Concepts**

| Concept       | Meaning                         | Keyword Reminder                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Encapsulation | Hide data & control access      | private + getter/setter          |
| Inheritance   | Child class gets parent features | extends                          |
| Polymorphism  | One name, many forms            | overloading + overriding         |
| Abstraction   | Show only important details     | abstract class + interface       |

---

## **Class & Object**

- **Class** = blueprint  
- **Object** = real instance of class  

---

## **Constructor**

Special method to initialize object (same name as class, no return type)

| Type | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Default | No parameters |
| Parameterized | Has parameters |
| Constructor Overloading | Multiple constructors with different params |

---

## **this vs super**

| this | super |
|------|------|
| Refers to current class | Refers to parent class |
| Access current variables/methods | Access parent variables/methods |
| Call current constructor | Call parent constructor |

---

## **Overloading vs Overriding**

| Overloading | Overriding |
|-------------|-----------|
| Same method name, different parameters | Same method name & parameters |
| Compile-time polymorphism | Runtime polymorphism |
| Same class | Inheritance required |

---

## **Type Casting**

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|--------|--------|
| Implicit (Widening) | Small → big | `int → double` |
| Explicit (Narrowing) | Big → small | `double → int` |

---

## **Array vs ArrayList vs LinkedList**

| Feature | Array | ArrayList | LinkedList |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Size | Fixed | Dynamic | Dynamic |
| Speed (access) | Fast | Fast | Slow |
| Insert/Delete | Slow | Average | Fast |

---

## **Exception Handling**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| try | Risky code |
| catch | Handle exception |
| finally | Always runs |
| throws | Pass exception to caller |
| throw | Manually throw exception |
| User defined exception | Custom class extends Exception |

---

## **Threading**

| Concept | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| Thread | Unit of execution |
| Creating thread | extends Thread / implements Runnable |
| start() | Begin thread |
| run() | Task code |
| sleep() | Pause thread |
| join() | Wait for another thread |
| isAlive() | Check thread running |
| Synchronization | Protect shared data |

---

## **Control Statements**

- `if`, `else`, `switch`
- `break`, `continue`
- `for`, `while`, `do-while`

---

## **Java Runtime**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| JVM | Runs bytecode |
| JRE | JVM + libraries |
| JDK | JRE + compiler (development kit) |

---

## ✅ **Super Quick Flash Notes**

- Java = OOP + secure + portable + platform independent  
- Bytecode → JVM converts to machine code  
- Package = folder for classes (`import package.*`)  
- Interface = 100% abstraction  
- Abstract class = partial abstraction  

---

## ✅ **30-Second Revision**

- OOP pillars = **EIPA**
- Overload = compile-time, same name, diff params  
- Override = runtime, same signature, child class  
- `this` = current | `super` = parent  
- `try-catch-finally` = handle errors safely  
- Threads = parallel execution
