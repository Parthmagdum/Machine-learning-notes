### Q. Write a short note on JVM. (4 Marks)

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is a software runtime environment that executes Java bytecode. It acts as an intermediary between Java programs and the operating system, enabling **platform independence**. JVM loads, verifies, and runs bytecode, and also handles memory management through garbage collection.

**Key Functions of JVM:**
- **Class Loader:** Loads Java class files into memory.
- **Bytecode Verifier:** Checks code for security and correctness.
- **Interpreter / JIT Compiler:** Executes bytecode and optimizes performance.
- **Memory Management:** Allocates memory and performs **garbage collection**.
- **Execution Engine:** Executes instructions and manages threads.
