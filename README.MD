## Notes website generator

This repository now includes a small static site generator to turn these markdown notes into a browsable website.

Quick start to build the site locally:

1. (Optional but recommended) create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Build the site:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

The generated site will be written to the `site/` directory. Open `site/index.html` in your browser to view.

Files added:

- `build.py` — generator script that converts each top-level `.md` into an HTML page and creates `site/index.html`.
- `templates/base.html` — simple HTML template used for pages.
- `static/style.css` — basic styling for the notes site.
- `requirements.txt` — minimal Python dependencies (markdown, pygments).

If you want a different layout, front-matter, tags, or search, tell me and I can extend the generator.

## Deploying on Netlify

This project includes a `netlify.toml` so Netlify can build and publish the site automatically.

What Netlify will run (configured in `netlify.toml`):

- Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Run `python3 build.py` to create the `site/` directory.
- Publish the `site/` directory as the website.

Quick steps to deploy:

1. Push your repository to GitHub (already done).
2. In Netlify, choose "New site from Git" and connect your GitHub account.
3. Select this repository (`PATILYASHH/Machine-learning-notes`).
4. Netlify will automatically pick up the `netlify.toml` build command and publish directory. If it doesn't, set the build command to:

```text
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 build.py
```

and set the publish directory to:

```text
site
```

Notes and tips
- If you prefer not to commit the generated `site/` files to the repo, add `site/` to `.gitignore` and remove the tracked files with `git rm -r --cached site` before pushing — Netlify will still build the site on its side using the `netlify.toml` build command.
- If your build requires a specific Python version, configure the Python version in the Netlify site UI (Environment > Build image settings) or include any runtime config required by your build environment.
