### Q. Explain in brief Thread Synchronization. (4 Marks)

Thread synchronization in Java is a technique used to **control the access of multiple threads to shared resources**.  
It prevents **data inconsistency** and ensures that only **one thread at a time** can access critical sections of the code.

---

### ✅ Why Synchronization?
- Avoids race conditions
- Maintains data consistency
- Ensures safe thread communication

---

### ✅ How to Achieve Synchronization
Java provides the `synchronized` keyword to lock a method or code block.

---

### ✅ Example

```java
class Counter {
    int count = 0;

    synchronized void increment() { // Synchronized method
        count++;
    }
}


---

✅ Output Meaning

Even if multiple threads call increment(), only one thread executes it at a time, ensuring correct results.


---

Synchronization helps in safe multithreading and avoids conflicts when threads share resources.
