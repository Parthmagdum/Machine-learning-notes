### Q. Define inheritance. Explain multilevel inheritance in Java with example. (8 Marks)

**Inheritance** in Java is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.  
It supports **code reusability** and **method overriding**, enabling **object-oriented hierarchy**.

The class that inherits is called **subclass/child class**, and the class being inherited from is called **superclass/parent class**.

### ✅ Multilevel Inheritance
Multilevel inheritance occurs when a class inherits from another class, and a third class inherits from that subclass — forming a **chain of inheritance**.

Grandparent → Parent → Child

### ✅ Example of Multilevel Inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Puppy p = new Puppy();
        p.eat();    // inherited from Animal
        p.bark();   // inherited from Dog
        p.sleep();  // own method
    }
}

✅ Output

Eating...
Barking...
Sleeping...

Multilevel inheritance allows features to be passed through multiple levels, improving reusability, readability, and code organization.
