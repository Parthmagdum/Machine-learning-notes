### Q. Describe access specifiers in Java. (4 Marks)

Access specifiers in Java define the **visibility and accessibility** of classes, methods, and variables. They control how and where members of a class can be accessed.

**Types of Access Specifiers:**

| Specifier        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **public**       | Accessible from anywhere in the program. |
| **protected**    | Accessible within the same class, same package, and subclasses (even in different packages). |
| **default** (no keyword) | Accessible only within the same package. |
| **private**      | Accessible only within the same class. |

**Example:**
```java
public class Demo {
    public int a;
    private int b;
    protected int c;
    int d; // default
}

Access specifiers help in data hiding, security, and controlled access to class members.
