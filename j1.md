### Q. Write a short note on Features of Java. (4 Marks)

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent** programming language that follows **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)** using bytecode and JVM. It is secure, portable, and robust, making it suitable for modern software development.

**Features of Java:**
- **Simple:** Easy syntax, no pointers, beginner-friendly.
- **Object-Oriented:** Uses classes, objects, and OOP principles.
- **Platform-Independent:** Same code runs on any OS via JVM.
- **Secure:** No direct memory access, bytecode verification, sandboxing.
- **Robust:** Garbage collection & exception handling improve reliability.
- **Multithreaded:** Allows parallel execution of multiple threads.
- **Portable:** Fixed data types and platform-independent bytecode.
- **High Performance:** JIT compiler boosts execution speed.
