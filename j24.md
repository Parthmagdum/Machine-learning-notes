### Q. Write short note on Abstraction in Java. (4 Marks)

Abstraction in Java is a concept of **hiding implementation details** and showing only the essential features to the user.  
It helps simplify complex systems by exposing only necessary functionality.

Abstraction is achieved using:
- **Abstract classes**
- **Interfaces**

#### ✅ Abstract Class Example
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound(); // abstract method

    void sleep() {        // concrete method
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

✅ Interface Example

interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts");
    }
}

Abstraction helps in reducing complexity, improving code security, and achieving loose coupling in programs.
