### Q. Explain any four operators in Java with example. (8 Marks)

Operators in Java are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They help in performing calculations, comparisons, and logical decisions.  
Below are four commonly used operators in Java:

---

#### 1. Arithmetic Operator
Used for basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 10, b = 5;
int sum = a + b;   // 15
int mul = a * b;   // 50


---

2. Relational Operator

Used to compare two values. It returns true or false.

Example:

int x = 10, y = 20;
boolean result = x < y; // true


---

3. Logical Operator

Used to combine multiple conditions (logical AND, OR, NOT).

Example:

int age = 20;
boolean check = (age > 18 && age < 30); // true


---

4. Assignment Operator

Used to assign values to variables.

Example:

int n = 5;
n += 3; // n = n + 3 → 8


---

These operators help in performing different types of operations in Java such as calculations, comparisons, logical decisions, and value assignment.
