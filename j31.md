### Q. Define inheritance. Explain single level inheritance in Java with example. (8 Marks)

**Inheritance** in Java is an object-oriented feature where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.  
It promotes **code reusability, method overriding, and hierarchical class structure**.

The class that inherits is called the **subclass (child class)**, and the class being inherited from is the **superclass (parent class)**.

### ✅ Single Level Inheritance
Single level inheritance occurs when **one class directly inherits another class**.

Parent → Child

### ✅ Example of Single Level Inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();   // inherited from Animal
        d.bark();  // Dog method
    }
}


---

✅ Output

Eating...
Barking...

Single level inheritance allows a child class to reuse the functionality of a single parent class, making the code clean and efficient.
