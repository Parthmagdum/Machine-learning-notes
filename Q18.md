### Explain Performance Measures of Machine Learning (8 Marks)

**Definition:**  
Performance measures in Machine Learning are **evaluation metrics** used to test how well a trained model performs on unseen data.  
They help to **compare different models** and understand how accurate, precise, or reliable a model’s predictions are.

---

### **1. Accuracy**
- It is the most common measure of model performance.  
- **Definition:** The ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.  
- **Formula:**

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

- **TP:** True Positive, **TN:** True Negative, **FP:** False Positive, **FN:** False Negative  
- **Example:** If a model predicts 90 correct results out of 100, accuracy = 90%.

---

### **2. Precision**
- Precision measures how many of the **predicted positives are actually correct**.  
- **Formula:**

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

- **Example:** In spam detection, high precision means most emails labeled as spam are really spam.

---

### **3. Recall (Sensitivity)**
- Recall tells how many of the **actual positives were correctly identified** by the model.  
- **Formula:**

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

- **Example:** In medical diagnosis, high recall means most sick patients were correctly diagnosed as sick.

---

### **4. F1 Score**
- F1 Score is the **harmonic mean of Precision and Recall**, useful when you need a balance between both.  
- **Formula:**

F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

- **Example:** Used when both false positives and false negatives are important.

---

### **5. Confusion Matrix**
- A **table representation** of prediction results that shows how well a classification model performed.  
- It helps visualize **true vs. predicted** classes.

| Actual \ Predicted | Positive | Negative |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Positive** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| **Negative** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

---

### **6. Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Commonly used in regression problems.  
- **Formula:**

MSE = (1/n) * Σ (Actual - Predicted)²

- Measures the **average squared difference** between actual and predicted values.

---

### **7. R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**
- Indicates how well data points fit a line or curve.  
- **Range:** 0 to 1  
- Closer to 1 means better performance.

✅ **In short:**  
Performance measures help to **evaluate model effectiveness**, **compare algorithms**, and **identify strengths and weaknesses** for both classification and regression problems.
