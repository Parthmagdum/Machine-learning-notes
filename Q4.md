Difference Between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) – 8 Marks

Definition:

Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is the broad field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can think, learn, and make decisions like humans.

Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being directly programmed.

Difference Between AI and ML

Basis	Artificial Intelligence (AI)	Machine Learning (ML)

1. Meaning	AI is a broad concept that aims to make machines smart and capable of performing human-like tasks.	ML is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching machines to learn from data.
2. Objective	To enable machines to simulate human intelligence and behavior.	To enable machines to learn from data and make predictions.
3. Scope	AI includes ML, Deep Learning, Robotics, and Expert Systems.	ML is a part of AI focused mainly on learning and prediction.
4. Data Dependency	AI can use rules, logic, and data.	ML is completely data-driven — it learns patterns from data.
5. Learning Ability	AI can reason, plan, and make decisions like humans.	ML learns automatically from past data and experience.
6. Human Intervention	AI may need human guidance for setting goals and interpreting results.	ML requires less human input once trained on data.
7. Output	Produces intelligent actions and decisions.	Produces predictions or classifications based on patterns.
8. Examples	Chatbots, Self-driving cars, Expert systems, Speech recognition.	Email spam filters, Recommendation systems, Price prediction.

✅ In short:

AI = The big idea of making machines act intelligently.

ML = A method inside AI that helps machines learn from data automatically.
So, every ML system is AI, but not every AI system uses ML.
