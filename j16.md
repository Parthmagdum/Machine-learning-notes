### Q. Define class and object. Explain with example how to define class and access fields and methods. (8 Marks)

A **class** in Java is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).

An **object** is an instance of a class that occupies memory and can access class members (fields and methods).

#### ✅ Example: Defining a class and accessing its fields & methods

```java
// Defining a class
class Student {
    String name;     // data member / field
    int age;

    void display() { // method
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object
        Student s = new Student();

        // Accessing fields
        s.name = "Rahul";
        s.age = 20;

        // Accessing method
        s.display();
    }
}

✅ Output

Name: Rahul
Age: 20

A class provides structure, and an object provides a usable instance of that structure. Objects access class fields and methods using the dot (.) operator.
