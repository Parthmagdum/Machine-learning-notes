## Steps to Design a Learning System (8 Marks)

A learning system in Machine Learning is a system that can learn from data, make predictions, and improve automatically.
Designing such a system involves several well-defined steps.


---

1. Problem Definition

Clearly define what problem you want to solve using ML.

Identify whether it’s classification, regression, or clustering.

Example: Predicting house prices, recognizing spam emails, etc.



---

2. Data Collection

Collect relevant and sufficient data from different sources like databases, sensors, or online platforms.

The quality of the data directly affects the performance of the model.



---

3. Data Preprocessing

Clean and prepare the data before using it.

Handle missing values, duplicates, and noise.

Perform feature scaling and normalization to make data suitable for ML models.



---

4. Data Splitting

Divide the data into training and testing sets.

The training set is used to teach the model, and the testing set is used to check how well it performs.



---

5. Model Selection

Choose the right Machine Learning algorithm based on the problem type and data nature.

Example:

Linear Regression → for continuous values

Decision Tree → for classification

K-Means → for clustering




---

6. Model Training

Feed the training data to the selected model.

The model learns patterns and relationships from the data during this phase.



---

7. Model Evaluation

Test the model using the testing dataset.

Measure performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error.



---

8. Model Deployment and Maintenance

Deploy the model into the real-world environment where it can make live predictions.

Continuously monitor and retrain the model with new data to keep it accurate and up to date.

✅ In short:
The 8 steps to design a learning system are —
Problem Definition → Data Collection → Data Preprocessing → Data Splitting → Model Selection → Model Training → Model Evaluation → Model Deployment.

These steps ensure the system learns effectively, performs accurately, and stays reliable in real-world use.
