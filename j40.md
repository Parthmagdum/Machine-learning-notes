### Q. Explain `isAlive()` and `join()` methods in multithreading. (4 Marks)

In Java multithreading, `isAlive()` and `join()` are useful methods provided by the `Thread` class to manage thread execution and synchronization.

---

#### ✅ `isAlive()` Method
- Used to check whether a thread is **still running** or has finished execution.
- Returns **true** if the thread is active, otherwise **false**.

**Syntax:**
```java
t.isAlive();

Example:

Thread t = new Thread();
t.start();
System.out.println(t.isAlive()); // true (if thread is running)


---

✅ join() Method

Used to pause the execution of the current thread until the specified thread completes.

Ensures that one thread waits for another to finish.


Syntax:

t.join();

Example:

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        t.join(); // Waits for t to finish
        System.out.println("Main thread continues...");
    }
}

These methods help in thread synchronization and lifecycle management in Java multithreading.
