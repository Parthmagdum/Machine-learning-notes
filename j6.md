### Q. Describe break and continue statements in Java. (4 Marks)

In Java, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements used inside loops and switch statements to change the normal flow of execution.

**break Statement:**
- Terminates the loop or switch block immediately.
- Control moves to the statement after the loop/switch.
```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    if(i == 3) break;
    System.out.println(i); // Output: 1, 2
}
'''
continue Statement:

Skips the current iteration of the loop and jumps to the next iteration.

Loop does not stop; only the current cycle is skipped.

'''
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    if(i == 3) continue;
    System.out.println(i); // Output: 1, 2, 4, 5
}
'''
These statements help control loop execution efficiently.
