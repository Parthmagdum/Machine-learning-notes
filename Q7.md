## Goals of Machine Learning

The main goals of Machine Learning (ML) are to make computers learn automatically from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

1. Automation of Decision Making

ML aims to help systems make automatic and accurate decisions without human help by learning patterns from past data.

2. Prediction and Forecasting

ML models can predict future outcomes such as sales, stock prices, or weather, based on historical data.

3. Pattern Recognition

ML identifies hidden patterns and relationships in large and complex datasets that humans may miss.

4. Continuous Improvement

ML algorithms keep improving their accuracy and performance as they are exposed to more data over time.

✅ In short:
The goal of ML is to create systems that learn from experience, make predictions, and improve automatically without explicit programming.
