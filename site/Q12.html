<hr>
<p>Need for Machine Learning:</p>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is needed because traditional programming cannot handle large and complex data efficiently.
In the modern world, data is generated at a huge scale — from social media, sensors, phones, and business systems — and ML helps in analyzing, understanding, and making predictions from this data automatically.</p>
<p>Key Reasons Why ML is Needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handling Large Amounts of Data:</li>
</ol>
<p>ML can process and analyze massive data faster than humans.</p>
<ol>
<li>Automation of Tasks:</li>
</ol>
<p>It helps in automating repetitive and time-consuming work like email sorting or fraud detection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Improved Accuracy:</li>
</ol>
<p>ML learns from past data to make predictions that get more accurate over time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Decision Making:</li>
</ol>
<p>It assists in making better decisions using data-driven insights.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pattern Recognition:</li>
</ol>
<p>ML discovers hidden trends and relationships in data that are difficult to find manually.</p>
<p>✅ In short:
Machine Learning is needed to make computers learn from data, improve automatically, and make intelligent decisions without manual programming.</p>
<hr>
<p>Classification of Machine Learning:</p>
<p>Machine Learning algorithms are classified into three main types based on how they learn from data.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Supervised Learning</li>
</ol>
<p>In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data, which means both input and output are known.</p>
<p>The goal is to learn the mapping from input to output.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Predicting house prices based on size and location.</p>
<p>Classifying emails as spam or not spam.</p>
<p>Common Algorithms:</p>
<p>Linear Regression</p>
<p>Decision Trees</p>
<p>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
</ol>
<p>The model is trained using unlabeled data — only inputs are given, and the algorithm finds patterns or groups on its own.</p>
<p>It is mainly used for clustering and association.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Customer segmentation based on shopping behavior.</p>
<p>Grouping similar images or documents.</p>
<p>Common Algorithms:</p>
<p>K-Means Clustering</p>
<p>Hierarchical Clustering</p>
<p>Apriori Algorithm</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
</ol>
<p>In reinforcement learning, the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.</p>
<p>The goal is to learn the best strategy (policy) to maximize rewards.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Game-playing AI like Chess or Go.</p>
<p>Self-driving cars learning to navigate roads.</p>
<p>Common Algorithms:</p>
<p>Q-Learning</p>
<p>Deep Q-Networks (DQN)</p>
<hr>
<p>✅ In short:
Machine Learning is needed to make systems intelligent and data-driven.
It is classified into:</p>
<p>Supervised Learning (learn from labeled data),</p>
<p>Unsupervised Learning (find hidden patterns), and</p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning (learn from experience and rewards).</p><button class="page-bookmark-btn" id="pageBookmarkBtn" data-slug="Q12.html" data-title="What is the need for ML? Explain in detail classification of ML" title="Bookmark this question"><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i></button>
