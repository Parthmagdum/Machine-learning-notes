### Q. Explain compilation and execution process of a Java program. (4 Marks)

In Java, programs go through two main steps: **compilation** and **execution**. Java uses the concept of **bytecode** and **JVM** to ensure platform independence.

**1. Compilation Phase:**
- Source code is written in `.java` file.
- The Java compiler (`javac`) compiles the code.
- Compiler checks syntax and errors.
- If successful, it generates **bytecode** in a `.class` file.

**2. Execution Phase:**
- The `.class` bytecode file is given to the **JVM**.
- JVM converts bytecode into machine code using **Interpreter** and **JIT Compiler**.
- JVM then executes the program on the operating system.

This process ensures Java follows **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)** principle.
